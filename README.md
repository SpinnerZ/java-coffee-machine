# Java Coffee Machine from JetBrains Exercise
A small project from JetBrains Academy ( https://hyperskill.org/onboarding/project?track=7 ) just to learn and pratice Git and Java

Learning outcomes
This project allows you to get a taste of Java. Practice working with classes, challenge yourself with loops and conditions, and get more confident in Java.

Stages completed: 5/6:

Stage 1/6: Hello, Coffe!
>Write a program that puts basic information on the screen: give the machine a chance to tell the customers what it’s doing!

Stage 2/6: Machines have needs
>Program the machine to calculate the amount of ingredients it needs depending on how many people want some coffee.

Stage 3/6: Enough coffee for everyone
>Working with conditions, program the machine to estimate how many creamy coffees it can make based on the amount of ingredients we enter.

Stage 4/6: Action!
>Upgrade your knowledge of methods - set the machine to perform three basic actions: collect the money, renew the supplies, and serve the coffee.

Stage 5/6: On a coffee loop
>Program the machine to display on the screen the amount of supplies left. Set the main loop: now the menu keeps updating until you enter “exit”.

Stage 6/6: Brush up your code
>Time for some final touch-ups: structure the code so that it runs smoothly.
